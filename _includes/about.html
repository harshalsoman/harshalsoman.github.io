  I'm a graduate student pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at University of Illinois at Chicago.
  Before I came to the USA I obtained my Bachelors in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from University of Mumbai. Passionate about Data Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.
  I love working with great people, getting creative with data, using state-of-the-art technologies and building awesome products.

      In a wide range of subject areas, I have analyzed structured and unstructured data to extract actionable business insights.
      I love to craft stunning and clever visualizations that illustrate surprising results.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Jupyter Notebooks.
      Using my software engineering skills, I've built and deployed AI services which create real business value.

      I enjoy public speaking, writing professional articles, sharing my knowledge and discussing diverse topics.
      Thanks to my training and experience in science communication, I'm able to present complex results to a non-technical audience.
